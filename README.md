# Raspberry Pi MotorRobot

## Description
Aftery many months i finally bought some stuff for my precious Raspberry Pi 3B+ computer and started tinkering. This is a repository for my attempt to build four-wheeled bot with some way to control it with bluetooth controller. I am also planning to use some machine learning algorithms in the future (but now this is just speculation).

## Used components
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Controller
- Dagu 4WD Magician Chassis (4x DC engines)
- 1x prototyping plate
- A log of wires and insulating tape
